<p>webAR-ARshoppy is a web-based augmented reality (AR) application that allows users to view and interact with 3D models of furniture and other objects in their own environment. Users can select from a variety of products, such as chairs, tables, couches, vases, and desks, and place them in their surroundings using their device's camera. Users can also adjust the size, position, and orientation of the models, and see how they look from different angles.</p>
